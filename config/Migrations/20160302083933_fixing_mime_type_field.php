 *
 * According to RFC 4288 "Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures",
 * type (eg. "application") and subtype (eg "vnd...") both can be max 127 characters.
 *
 * Meanwhile, that document has been obsoleted by RFC 6838, which does not alter
 * the maximum size but adds a remark:
 *
 * Also note that while this syntax allows names of up to 127 characters,
 * implementation limits may make such long names problematic. For this reason,
 * <type-name> and <subtype-name> SHOULD be limited to 64 characters.
