The Image Helper
================

The plugin comes with an Image helper that makes it easy to display the images generated by the ImageStorage model and the events that process the images.

```php
namespace App\View;
class AppView extends View {
	public function initialize() {
		parent::initialize();
		$this->loadHelper('FileStorage.Image');
	}
}
```

In your views you can now access all your image versions, which you have declared before in your config through the helper.

```php
echo $this->Image->display($product['image'], 'small');
```

If you want the original image just call the display() method without a version.

```php
echo $this->Image->display($product['image']);
```

If you want to get only the URL to an image you can call ```imageUrl()```.

```php
$imageUrl = $this->Image->imageUrl($product['image'], 'small');
echo $this->Html->image($imageUrl);
```

Options for display() and imageUrl()
------------------------------------

The third argument of both methods is an option array, right now it has only one option to set.

* **fallback:** Optional, can be boolean true or string. If boolean true it will use ```placeholder/<YOUR-VERSION>.jpg``` as place  holder. If string it will use that as image.
